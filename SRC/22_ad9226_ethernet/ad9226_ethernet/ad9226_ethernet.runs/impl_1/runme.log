WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 eth_top_inst/mac_inst/icmp0/icmp_receive_ram/ram_reg has an input control pin eth_top_inst/mac_inst/icmp0/icmp_receive_ram/ram_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[8] (net: eth_top_inst/mac_inst/icmp0/icmp_receive_ram/icmp_rec_ram_read_addr_reg[7][4]) which is driven by a register (eth_top_inst/mac_inst/icmp0/icmp_rec_ram_read_addr_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
